            <p>
                Mitosis is the last and the most important part of the Cell Cycle.
                The cell undergoes transformations before splitting into 2 daughter cells (cytokinesis).
                This process is broken down into 4 parts: prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase.

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Prophase</h2>
            <p>
                Prophase is the first step of mitosis.
                In this phase, the centrioles of the cell move to opposite ends. 
                The nucleus disappears. Asters and
                microtubules called spindle fibers form. 
                The chromosomes now visible move to the equator of the cell.
            </p>
<br>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Metaphase</h2>
            <p>
                In metaphase, the spidle fibers that formed in prophase now attach to the centromere(central part) 
                of the chromosomes that were aligned on the equator.
                The centromeres then split.
            </p>
<br>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Anaphase</h2>
            <p>
                The next phase is anaphase. 
                The chromosomes are pulled by the spindle fibers towards the opposite poles where the centrioles are.

            </p>
<br>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Telophase and Cytokinesis</h2>
            <p>
                Telophase is the last part of mitosis. 
                The chromosomes start to uncoil and become chromatin. 
                The asters and spindle fibers disappear.
                The nucleus membrane reappears and wraps the chromatin.
                When it's done, the cell starts to pinch.<br>
                In Cytokinesis, there is not a lot going on. 
                The cell simply continues to pinch in the middle until 2 cells are formed.
                The resulting cells are diploid cells.
